# 🚀 START HERE - Fix Your Website in 2 Steps

## Your website doesn't work because:
1. ❌ No `.env` configuration file
2. ❌ No database connection

## ✅ SOLUTION - Run This ONE Command:

```powershell
.\SETUP_AND_START.ps1
```

This script will:
- ✅ Create your `.env` file automatically
- ✅ Check if MongoDB is set up
- ✅ Guide you to set up MongoDB Atlas (free) if needed
- ✅ Start both servers for you
- ✅ Open your website

---

## 📋 What Happens Next:

### If MongoDB is NOT set up (first time):

The script will:
1. Detect you need MongoDB
2. Ask if you want to open MongoDB Atlas signup
3. Show you exactly what to do
4. Wait for you to complete setup

**Then you just run the script again!**

### If MongoDB IS set up:

The script will:
1. Start your backend server (port 5000)
2. Start your frontend server (port 3000)
3. Tell you to open http://localhost:3000

---

## 🆘 Alternative: Manual Steps

If the script doesn't work:

### 1. Create .env file:
```powershell
Copy-Item "server\env-template.txt" "server\.env"
```

### 2. Set up MongoDB Atlas:
- Go to: https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register
- Create free M0 cluster
- Get connection string
- Update `MONGO_URI` in `server\.env`

### 3. Start servers (use separate PowerShell windows):

**Window 1:**
```powershell
cd server
npm run dev
```

**Window 2:**
```powershell
cd client
npm run dev
```

### 4. Open browser:
```
http://localhost:3000
```
