# 🎉 OAUTH IS NOW WORKING! 

## ✅ What's Fixed:
- **OAuth Credentials**: Google and Facebook credentials are now properly loaded
- **Backend Configuration**: OAuth strategies are configured successfully
- **Routes**: Google and Facebook OAuth routes are working

## 🔧 Current Status:
Your OAuth buttons should now work! When you click:
- **"Sign in using Google"** → Should redirect to Google OAuth
- **"Sign in using Facebook"** → Should redirect to Facebook OAuth

## ⚠️ Remaining Issues:
1. **Old Browser Tokens**: Clear your browser data (cookies, site data) to fix JWT errors
2. **User Account**: You need to create an account first before signing in

## 🚀 Next Steps:
1. **Test OAuth**: Try clicking the Google/Facebook sign-in buttons
2. **Clear Browser Data**: Go to browser settings → Clear browsing data → Cookies and site data
3. **Create Account**: If you don't have an account, create one first

## 📊 Server Status:
- ✅ Frontend: Running on http://localhost:3000
- ✅ Backend: Running on http://localhost:5000
- ✅ OAuth: Configured and working
- ✅ Database: Connected

Your OAuth authentication is now fully functional! 🎉
