# Dashboard Deployment Fix - useSearchParams Suspense Boundary

## Problem
When deploying the frontend to Render, the build was failing with the error:
```
тип useSearchParams() should be wrapped in a suspense boundary at page "/Dashboard"
```

This error occurs because Next.js 15 requires `useSearchParams()` to be wrapped in a Suspense boundary when pages are being statically generated during the build process.

## Solution
The fix involved restructuring the Dashboard component to properly handle the dynamic search parameters:

### Changes Made to `client/src/app/Dashboard/page.js`:

1. **Added Suspense import** from React

2. **Created `OAuthSuccessHandler` component**:
   - Extracted the OAuth success handling logic that uses `useSearchParams()`
   - This component is now a separate component that can be wrapped in Suspense
   - Returns `null` (it's just a side-effect component)

3. **Renamed main component to `DashboardContent`**:
   - Removed `useSearchParams()` usage from this component
   - Removed the OAuth handling useEffect (moved to OAuthSuccessHandler)
   - All other functionality remains the same

4. **Created new `Dashboard` wrapper component**:
   - Wraps everything in `<ErrorBoundary>`
   - Includes `<Suspense>` with a proper loading fallback
   - Renders both `<OAuthSuccessHandler />` and `<DashboardContent />` inside Suspense
   - The fallback shows a loading spinner matching the app's design

## Why This Works
- **Suspense boundary**: Tells Next.js that this part of the page is dynamic and should be handled client-side
- **Separation of concerns**: The search params handling is isolated in its own component
- **Static generation**: The build process can now properly generate static pages while knowing that search params will be handled dynamically on the client

## Next Steps for Deployment
1. Commit these changes:
   ```bash
   git add client/src/app/Dashboard/page.js
   git commit -m "Fix: Wrap useSearchParams in Suspense boundary for Dashboard page"
   git push
   ```

2. Redeploy on Render - the build should now succeed!

## Additional Notes
- The warning about multiple lockfiles is just a warning and won't cause build failure
- Consider consolidating lockfiles by removing `client/package-lock.json` if you want (though not required)
- All functionality remains exactly the same - this is purely a structural fix for Next.js 15 compatibility
