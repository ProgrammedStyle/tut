# 🟢 Server Status

## ✅ What's Running:

### Backend Server (Port 5000) - ✅ RUNNING
- Status: **Working perfectly!**
- URL: http://localhost:5000
- No errors (except optional OAuth warnings - those are fine)

### Frontend Server (Port 3000) - ✅ STARTING
- Status: **Starting now...**
- URL: http://localhost:3000
- Wait 10-20 seconds for it to compile

---

## 🎯 You Need BOTH Servers Running:

| Server | Port | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| **Backend** | 5000 | API, database, authentication |
| **Frontend** | 3000 | Your website UI |

---

## 📱 How to Check:

### Backend is working if you see:
```
Server running successfuly, Port: 5000
```
✅ **You have this!**

### Frontend is working if you see:
```
▲ Next.js 15.4.1
- Local:        http://localhost:3000
✓ Ready in X.Xs
```
⏱️ **Starting now... wait 10-20 seconds**

---

## 🌐 Then Open:

**http://localhost:3000**

Your website should now load! 🎉

---

## ⚠️ If Frontend Shows Errors:

Common issues and fixes:

### "Cannot connect to backend"
- Make sure backend (port 5000) is still running
- Check `client/src/app/utils/axios.js` has `baseURL: 'http://localhost:5000'`

### Port 3000 already in use
```powershell
# Kill the process using port 3000
Get-Process -Id (Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 3000).OwningProcess | Stop-Process -Force

# Then restart frontend
cd client
npm run dev
```

### "Module not found" errors
```powershell
cd client
npm install
```

---

## 🛑 To Stop Servers:

Press **Ctrl+C** in each terminal window

---

## 💡 Pro Tip:

Next time, use this to start both servers at once:
```powershell
.\SETUP_AND_START.ps1
```

This opens both servers in separate windows automatically!
