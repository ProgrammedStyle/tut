# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL FIX APPLIED - RESTART BACKEND NOW!

## What Was Wrong:
The OAuth credentials check was happening at **import time** (when the server starts) instead of **runtime** (when you click the button). This means even though you restored the credentials, the old check result was cached.

## What I Fixed:
âœ… Moved the OAuth credential check to happen every time the route is accessed
âœ… Now it will correctly detect your restored credentials

## ðŸ”´ IMPORTANT - YOU MUST RESTART THE BACKEND:

### Step 1: Stop the backend server
Go to the terminal where the backend is running and press:
```
Ctrl + C
```

### Step 2: Start it again
```powershell
cd server
npm run dev
```

## Expected Output:
You should see:
```
âœ“ Configuring Google OAuth
âœ“ Configuring Facebook OAuth
```

## Then Test:
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/CreateAccount
2. Click "Sign in using Google"
3. You should be redirected to Google's login page âœ…
