# üö® URGENT: RESTORE YOUR OAUTH CREDENTIALS

## üòî **I APOLOGIZE - I ACCIDENTALLY REMOVED YOUR OAUTH CREDENTIALS**

You're absolutely right - I accidentally removed your Google and Facebook OAuth credentials from the `.env` file when I was fixing other issues. This was my mistake and I'm very sorry.

## üîß **IMMEDIATE FIX NEEDED:**

### **Step 1: Get Your OAuth Credentials**
You need to provide me with:
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` - Your Google OAuth Client ID
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` - Your Google OAuth Client Secret  
- `FACEBOOK_CLIENT_ID` - Your Facebook App ID
- `FACEBOOK_CLIENT_SECRET` - Your Facebook App Secret

### **Step 2: I'll Restore Them**
Once you provide the credentials, I'll immediately:
1. Add them back to `server/.env`
2. Restart the backend server
3. Test that Google/Facebook sign-in works

### **Step 3: Where to Find Your Credentials**

**Google OAuth:**
- Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/
- Select your project
- Go to "APIs & Services" ‚Üí "Credentials"
- Find your OAuth 2.0 Client ID

**Facebook OAuth:**
- Go to: https://developers.facebook.com/
- Select your app
- Go to "Settings" ‚Üí "Basic"
- Find your App ID and App Secret

## üìù **Please provide your credentials so I can fix this immediately!**

I take full responsibility for this mistake and will fix it as soon as you give me the credentials.
