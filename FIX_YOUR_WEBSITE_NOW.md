# 🔥 YOUR WEBSITE IS NOT WORKING - HERE'S WHY AND HOW TO FIX IT

## 🚨 THE PROBLEM

Your Jerusalem Virtual Guide website has **2 critical missing components**:

### ❌ 1. Missing Environment Configuration File
Your backend server needs a `.env` file with database credentials and configuration, but it doesn't exist.

### ❌ 2. No Database Connection
You don't have MongoDB installed, so the backend can't store or retrieve data.

---

## ✅ THE SOLUTION (5 Minutes)

### 🎯 FASTEST WAY - Run This One Command:

Open PowerShell in your project root and run:

```powershell
.\complete-setup.ps1
```

This will:
- ✅ Create your `.env` file automatically
- ✅ Check all your installations
- ✅ Install any missing dependencies
- ✅ Give you clear next steps

### 📝 Manual Method (if script doesn't work):

#### Step 1: Create the `.env` file
1. Go to `server` folder
2. Find the file `env-template.txt`
3. Copy it and rename the copy to `.env` (just `.env`, no .txt)
   - **Important**: Make sure it's named exactly `.env` not `.env.txt`

#### Step 2: Set up MongoDB Database

**🌟 RECOMMENDED: MongoDB Atlas (Free Cloud Database)**

This is the easiest option - no installation needed!

1. **Sign up** at https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register
   
2. **Create a FREE cluster**:
   - Click "Build a Database"
   - Choose "FREE" (M0)
   - Click "Create"
   - Wait 3-5 minutes for it to be ready

3. **Create a database user**:
   - Click "Database Access" in left menu
   - Click "Add New Database User"
   - Choose "Password" authentication
   - Create a username and password (SAVE THESE!)
   - Give it "Atlas Admin" role
   - Click "Add User"

4. **Whitelist your IP**:
   - Click "Network Access" in left menu
   - Click "Add IP Address"
   - Click "Allow Access from Anywhere" (or add your IP)
   - Click "Confirm"

5. **Get your connection string**:
   - Click "Database" in left menu
   - Click "Connect" on your cluster
   - Choose "Connect your application"
   - Copy the connection string (looks like: `mongodb+srv://...`)
   
6. **Update your `.env` file**:
   - Open `server/.env`
   - Find the line that says `MONGO_URI=...`
   - Replace it with your connection string
   - **IMPORTANT**: Replace `<password>` with your actual database password!
   
   Example:
   ```
   MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://myusername:mypassword123@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/jerusalem-guide
   ```

#### Step 3: Start Your Servers

Open **TWO** PowerShell windows:

**Window 1 - Backend:**
```powershell
cd server
npm run dev
```

**Window 2 - Frontend:**
```powershell
cd client
npm run dev
```

#### Step 4: Test It!

Open your browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

🎉 **Your website should now be working!**

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: "Database connection failed"

**Solution:** 
- Check that `MONGO_URI` in `server/.env` is correct
- If using MongoDB Atlas:
  - Make sure you replaced `<password>` with your actual password
  - Make sure you whitelisted your IP address
  - Make sure the connection string doesn't have `<>` brackets

### Problem: "Environment variables NOT SET"

**Solution:**
- Make sure the file is named `.env` (not `.env.txt`)
- Make sure it's in the `server` folder (not the root)
- Try restarting the backend server

### Problem: "Port 5000 already in use"

**Solution:**
- Kill the process using port 5000, or
- Change `PORT=5000` to `PORT=5001` in `server/.env`

### Problem: "Cannot find module"

**Solution:**
```powershell
cd server
npm install

cd ../client
npm install
```

### Problem: Frontend shows errors in console

**Solution:**
- Make sure backend is running first
- Check that backend is running on port 5000
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl + F5)

## 🎯 QUICK CHECKLIST

- [ ] Create `server/.env` file (run `.\complete-setup.ps1` or copy from `env-template.txt`)
- [ ] Set up MongoDB Atlas account
- [ ] Update `MONGO_URI` in `server/.env` with your connection string
- [ ] Start backend server (`cd server && npm run dev`)
- [ ] Start frontend server (`cd client && npm run dev`)
- [ ] Open http://localhost:3000 in browser
- [ ] Website works! 🎉

## 💡 NEED MORE HELP?

1. **Run the setup script**: `.\complete-setup.ps1`
2. **Check the detailed guide**: `QUICK_START.md`
3. **Environment setup help**: `ENV_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

## 🔐 SECURITY NOTE

The template includes default values for testing. For production, you should:
- Change JWT secrets to random strings
- Use your own email SMTP credentials
- Keep your `.env` file private (never commit to git)

The `.env` file is already in `.gitignore` so it won't be accidentally committed.

---

**Bottom line: Your code is fine, you just need to configure the environment and database!**
